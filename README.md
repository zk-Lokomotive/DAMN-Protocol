## Decentralized AI Multi Purpose Network

### 1. Overall Architecture
The project will consist of the following main components:
- **User Interface (UI)**: A web or mobile application where users can generate visuals using AI and convert them into NFTs on the **Sui blockchain**.
- **Stable Diffusion AI Module**: The AI model responsible for visual generation.
- **GPU Leasing and Utilization System**: A system where users can lease other people's **GPUs** for AI computations, or use their **local GPUs**.
- **Sui Blockchain**: Used for converting generated visuals into **NFTs** and managing GPU leasing transactions.
- **RPC and Node Infrastructure**: Provides access to GPUs for AI computations via **RPCs**.

### 2. User Interface (UI)
The web or mobile application will include the following functionalities:
- Interface for generating visuals with AI.
- Button to convert generated visuals into NFTs.
- Options for GPU leasing and a list of available GPUs.
- Wallet integration and Sui token transactions.

### 3. Stable Diffusion AI Module
The Stable Diffusion model will generate visuals based on user inputs. This module will operate as follows:
- The user provides input through the UI (e.g., a text description).
- This input is sent to the Stable Diffusion model.
- The model generates a visual based on the input and returns the result to the user.

### 4. GPU Leasing and Utilization System
This system allows users to lease other people's GPUs for AI computations:
- When a user wants to lease a GPU, a list of available GPUs and their leasing costs are displayed.
- The user selects a GPU, pays the required amount of Sui tokens, and leases the GPU.
- The leased GPU is used to run the Stable Diffusion model, and the result is returned to the user.
- GPU owners earn tokens at the end of the leasing transaction.

### 5. Sui Blockchain Integration
The Sui blockchain will be used for both NFT creation and managing GPU leasing transactions:
- Generated visuals are converted into NFTs on the Sui blockchain.
- Each NFT is sent to the user's wallet.
- GPU leasing transactions are conducted via token transfers on the Sui blockchain.

### 6. RPC and Node Infrastructure
The RPC and node infrastructure will provide access to GPUs for AI computations:
- Users make RPC calls to initiate AI computations on the selected GPU.
- These calls are routed to the appropriate GPUs, and computations are performed.
- Results are returned to the user interface.

### Detailed Steps
1. **User Registration and Wallet Integration**: Users register for the project and connect their Sui wallets.
2. **Visual Generation with AI**: Users log in, provide input for visual generation, and initiate the process.
3. **GPU Leasing**: Users select and lease an available GPU, paying the required amount of tokens.
4. **AI Computations**: The leased GPU performs the AI computations, and the results are returned to the user.
5. **NFT Creation**: Users convert the generated visuals into NFTs and record them on the Sui blockchain.
6. **Token Transfers**: GPU owners earn tokens at the end of the leasing transaction.

### Technical Infrastructure and Requirements
- **Web and Mobile Development**: Modern frameworks such as React, Vue.js, or Angular can be used.
- **AI Module**: Suitable frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow or PyTorch) can be used for the Stable Diffusion model.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Sui SDK or similar tools can be used for integrating with the Sui blockchain.
- **Backend and RPC Infrastructure**: Node.js or Python-based backend solutions can be used for managing RPC calls.
- **Database**: Databases like PostgreSQL or MongoDB can be used for storing user and transaction data.
